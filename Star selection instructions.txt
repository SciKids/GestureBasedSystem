LAYOUT & INSTRUCTIONS FOR STAR SELECTION:
- Change camera layout-- 
	* Camera projection: Orthographic
	* Camera size: 3 (makes editing easier).
	* Camera position: 0,0,0
- Change canvas render mode to "Screen Space - Camera" (make sure to drag the main camera into the render camera field).
- Drag right and left hand prefabs onto space (not on canvas - might change this if I can't get scaling to work w/ calibration).
- Drag HandGesturesScripts prefab onto space (not on canvas) and drag the right & left hands and the camera onto the public fields
- Change button layout on all buttons in scene -- 
	* Buttons should have a box collider surrounding the whole thing. Check the "is trigger" box.
	* Buttons also need a rigidbody. Uncheck "Use Gravity", check "Is Kinematic", and check all boxes for "freeze position" & "freeze rotation"
	* Add the "Button" tag. The star can't click on a button without the button tag.
- Find and uncheck the hand cursor script 
- Drag the YellowStar3 prefab onto space (not on canvas) and drag the right and left hands onto the public fields in "Move Star V2"
Star should now be able to click on a button once the user lets go of the star. The star will do a quick animation before clicking.
