Project Headquarters - Today Recruiting for…Educational Video Game StartUp Company;
You and a friend have an idea for a startup company… to create an educational video game that will teach students about career paths in science. You both are software developers, but will need help with what content to include and how to deliver it to various age groups as well as someone to secure sales of your product once it is ready for release. Additionally, you’re going to need help with the creation of special sensors that integrate the players’ actions with the game itself. Finally, you’ll need a person to document the creation of the game to drive interest in buying it by getting the word out to the general public.;
Help us bring together a team of experts who can make this educational video game a reality!: Our team needs people to code, create content, design and integrate sensors, and find schools and parents to purchase the game when it’s finished.;
